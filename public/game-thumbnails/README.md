All 3D models are already implemented in the game's intro screen.

### Creating a Composite Thumbnail
For the best thumbnail (7.jpg), consider creating a composite image that shows:
- The kid running in the foreground
- The dog chasing behind
- The village/farm destination in the background

Image recommendations:
- Use JPG format for best performance
- Recommended size: 400x240 pixels or 16:9 aspect ratio
- Keep file size under 100KB for optimal loading
- Use vibrant, kid-friendly images related to the game content

If thumbnails are missing, the application will automatically fall back to placeholder images.
