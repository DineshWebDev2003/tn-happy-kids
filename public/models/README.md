# 3D Models for Your Game

This directory is where you should place your 3D models for use in the game.

## How to Download Models from Sketchfab

1. Create a Sketchfab account at https://sketchfab.com/
2. Search for a model you like (e.g., "dog", "kid", "village")
3. Look for models that are downloadable (some require purchase)
4. Download the model in GLB format if available
5. Rename the file appropriately (e.g., dog.glb, kid.glb, village.glb)
6. Place the .glb file in this directory

## Models Used in the Example

The basic 3D example page is looking for these files:

- `dog.glb` - A dog model for demonstration
- (Add more as needed)

## Sketchfab Model Links

Here are direct links to the models shown in your game:

## Converting Models

If you need to convert models between formats, you can use tools like:
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (free, powerful)
- [gltf.report](https://gltf.report/) (online converter)

## File Size Considerations

For web games, it's important to keep file sizes small:
- Aim for models under 5MB when possible
- Consider reducing polygon count for better performance
- Compress textures to reduce file size
